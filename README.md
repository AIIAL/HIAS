# Introduction
The **Peter Moss Leukemia AI Research HIAS Network** is an open-source Hospital Intelligent Automation System. The HIAS server powers an intelligent network providing secure access to devices on the network via a proxy. These devices/applications and databases all run and communicate on the local network. This means that premises have more control and security when it comes to their hardware, data and storage.

Devices and applications on the HIAS network communicate with the server and each other using a local MQTT broker.

The server hosts a private Ethereum blockchain which is integrated with the UI and provides upholds network access permissions, provides data integrity and accountability.

__This project is a proof of concept, and is still a work in progress.__

# HIAS Network
![HIAS Network](Media/Images/HIAS-Network-Devices.png)

The HIAS Network consists of a range of open-source IoT devices and applications including data analysis systems, diagnosis systems, robots, facial recognition security systems and natural language understanding engines. The network devices are designed and optimized to run on low resource devices. Devices and applications can communicate autonomously using rules and the iotJumpWay MQTT broker.

&nbsp;

# HIAS UI
![HIAS UI](Media/Images/dashboard.png)

The HIAS UI is the central control panel for the server, and all of the modular devices and applications that can be installed on it. The server UI provides the capabalities to manage the network of open-soruce intelligent devices and applications.

&nbsp;

# HIAS Blockchain
The HIAS Blockchain is a private Ethereum blockchain network that provides an immutable history of everything that happens on the HIAS network. Every user/device and application has a HIAS Blockchain address, meaning their actions can be recorded on the blockchain. Smart contracts provide additional security when it comes to verifying permissions, data hashes are stored on the blockchain providing data integrity. and each action made by staff members in the UI is recorded. The HIAS Blockchain network can be extended by installing additional full miner nodes which help to create blocks, seal transaction blocks, and also have a full copy of the entire HIAS Blockchain which remain synchronized.

&nbsp;

# HIAS Data Systems Interface
![HIAS Data Systems Interface](Media/Images/HDSI-Context-Broker.jpg)

The HIAS Data Services Interface is a context broker that handles contextual information for the HIAS network. The broker implements the HDSI V1 API and allows easy management of HIAS iotJumpWay IoT Agents, AI Models, Devices, Applications, and HIAS Staff & Patient accounts and their related contextual data. HDSI is based on [Open Mobile Alliance](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/)'s [NGSI](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/NGSI/V1_0-20120529-A/OMA-TS-NGSI_Context_Management-V1_0-20120529-A.pdf), and has been customized to meet the requirements of the HIAS network.

All iotJumpWay IoT Agents, AI Models, Devices, Applications, and HIAS Staff & Patient accounts have unique schemas that standardize their information and setup, these schemas are stored in the context broker.

## HDSI IoT Agents
![HDSI IoT Agents](Media/Images/HDSI-IoT-Agents.jpg)

The HDSI IoT Agents translate and push data sent from iotJumpWay Devices & Applications to the HDSI Context Broker. Each IoT Agent is responsible for it's own communication protocol, or transport. Current supported IoT protocols include HTTP, MQTT, Websockets & AMQP, with a CoAP broker and IoT Agent in development. The IoT Agents listen to data being sent on using their protocol and sends contextual data to the context broker, and historical data is stored in directly in the Mongo database.

### MQTT
The MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol is one of the most well known and popular machine to machine communication protocols. Developed by IBM's Dr. Andy Stanford-Clark, the protocol is a lightweight publish and subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices. MQTT is primary communciation on the HIAS network.

### AMQP
The AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) is another popular machine to machine communication protocol. Although different to MQTT, it has the same function, allowing constrained devices and applications to communicate with each other.

&nbsp;

# HIAS iotJumpWay Network
![HIAS IoT](Media/Images/HIAS-IoT-Dashboard.png)

The HIAS IoT network is powered by a new, fully open-source version of the [iotJumpWay](https://www.iotJumpWay.com "iotJumpWay"). The HIAS iotJumpway dashboard is your control panel for managing all of your network iotJumpWay zones, devices, sensors/actuators and applications.

The iotJumpWay devices and applications that make up the HIAS network are connected to the HIAS network via the iotJumpWay. Each device and application has a unique identifier and credentials that allow communication with the server and devices behind the firewall and proxy.

A HIAS network is represented by an iotJumpWay location. Within each location you can have multiple zones, devices and applications.

## HIAS IoT Zones
![HIAS IoT Zones](Media/Images/HIAS-IoT-Zones.png)

iotJumpWay Zones represent a room or area within a location. For instance, in a hospital you may have zones such as *Reception*, *Waiting Room*, *Operating Room 1* etc.

![HIAS IoT Zones](Media/Images/HIAS-IoT-Zones-Edit.png)

## HIAS IoT Devices
![HIAS IoT Devices](Media/Images/HIAS-IoT-Devices.png)

iotJumpWay Devices represent physical devices on the network. Each device is attached to a location and zone, allowing staff to know where each of their devices are, all devices publish their location to the network allowing for real-time tracking within the network.

![HIAS IoT Devices](Media/Images/HIAS-IoT-Devices-Edit.png)

## HIAS IoT Sensors/Actuators
![HIAS IoT Sensors/Actuators](Media/Images/HIAS-IoT-Sensors.png)

iotJumpWay Sensors & Actuators represent physical sensors and actuators included on network devices and allows direct communication with each sensor/actuator.

**This feature is still in development**

## HIAS IoT Applications
![HIAS IoT Applications](Media/Images/HIAS-IoT-Applications.png)

iotJumpWay Devices represent applications that can communicate with the  network. Each application is attached to a location, soon all applications will publish their location to the system allowing for real-time tracking.

![HIAS IoT Applications](Media/Images/HIAS-IoT-Applications-Edit.png)

## HIAS IoT Data
![HIAS IoT Data](Media/Images/HIAS-IoT-Data.png)

All data sent from devices and applications connected to the HIAS network is stored locally in a Mongo database (NoSQL). This means that staff can monitor all data on their network, and kall data stays on the network giving organizations total control of their data.

## HIAS IoT Data Smart Contract
![HIAS IoT Data Smart Contract](Media/Images/HIAS-IoT-Data-Smart-Contract.png)

The HIAS Blockchain hosts an iotJumpWay smart contract responsible for veryifing read and write access for iotJumpWay devices and applications, and storing immutable records of hashes of the data that is stored in the IoT database. The hashes provide the ability to verify data integrity by comparing the data in the database with the hash on the blockchain. The HIAS IoT Data Dashboard provides the functionality for checking the existing data against the hash on the blockchain.

&nbsp;

# HIAS Artificial Intelligence
The HIAS network is made up of multiple open-source AI models, these models are provided through our official Github organization, as well as our research project Githubs. Current models available for the HIAS network include Leukemia and COVID classifiers, facial recognition and natural language understanding.

## HDSI AI Model Schemas
![HDSI AI Model Schemas](Media/Images/HDSI-AI-Model-Schemas.jpg)
The HDSI schemas provide an easy way to manage and use the HIAS AI models. The schemas provide a standardization that allows you to not only use our models, but easily create your own and use them with the HIAS network.

 ## HIAS Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Detection System (CNN)
![HIAS COVID-19 Diagnosis (CNN)](Media/Images/HIAS-ALL-Detection-System.png)

The classifier achieves 98% accuracy at detecting Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in unseen data.

## HIAS COVID-19 Detection System (CNN)
![HIAS COVID-19 Diagnosis (CNN)](Media/Images/HIAS-COVID-19-Detection-System.png)

 The HIAS COVID-19 Detection System (CNN) system uses the [COVID-19 Tensorflow DenseNet Classifier](https://github.com/COVID-19-AI-Research-Project/AI-Classification/tree/master/Projects/2 "COVID-19 Tensorflow DenseNet Classifier") project, a Tensorflow 2 DenseNet implementation using the [SARS-COV-2 Ct-Scan Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/plameneduardo/sarscov2-ctscan-dataset "SARS-COV-2 Ct-Scan Dataset") by our collaborators, Plamenlancaster: [Professor Plamen Angelov](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lira/people/#d.en.397371) from [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/)/ Centre Director @ [Lira](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lira/), & his researcher, [Eduardo Soares PhD](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sci-tech/about-us/people/eduardo-almeida-soares). The classifier achieves 92% accuracy at detecting COVID-19 in unseen data.

## HIAS Facial Recognition API
![HIAS Facial Recognition](Media/Images/HIAS-Facial-Recognition.png)

The HIAS facial recognition API is based on [TassAI](https://www.facebook.com/TassAI/ "TassAI"). The API allows for facial identification using authenticated HTTP requests from devices and applications that are authorized to communicate with the HIAS network.

A range of open-source facial recognition systems can be attached to the network and use web and IP cameras attached to devices that process frames from the cameras in real-time, before streaming the processed framed to a local server endpoint.

Multiple TassAI facial recognition devices can be configured. The cameras track known and unknown users and can communicate with the Natural Language Understanding Engines allowing conversations to be triggered based on facial recognition identifications.

![HIAS Facial Recognition](Media/Images/HIAS-Facial-Recognition-Edit.png)

&nbsp;

## HIAS Natural Language Understanding Engines
![HIAS Natural Language Understanding Engines](Media/Images/HIAS-NLU.jpg)

The HIAS UI allows Natural Language Understanding Engines to be connected to the network. These NLUs can be communicated with via the network allowing applications and devices to have realtime spoken interactions with known and unknown users.
